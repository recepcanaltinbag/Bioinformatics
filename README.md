# Computational Biology
Most of the algorithms were implemented with help of pseudo-codes from MIT - Computational Biology lectures.  
#
- Gene Alignment with Dynamic Programming
- Hidden Markov Model with Viterbi Algorithm to find GC rich regions in DNA
- Burrows - Wheeler Transform to find matches 
- Gene annotation visualization of GFF Files with using pyGUI, GFF Parser, Biopython and DnaFeaturesViewer
